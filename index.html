                <h2>Registration to the Challenge</h2>
                <p>The first step to compete in the challenge is 
                    to register your group. 
                    To do so send a mail to <a href="mailto:michele.delliveneri@na.infn.it">michele.delliveneri@na.infn.it</a>
                    containing the following information:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Names of the partecipants</li>
                        <li>Department, name and email of your supervisor</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please keep in mind that groups should contain a maximum number of 3 students which may
                    or may not be from the same department.

                <h2>Objective and Structure of the Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    The objective of the challenge is to simulate
                    an industrial Data Science project as you would encounter
                    working as a data scientist for a company or an interdisciplinary
                    research group. The challenge is about predicting the <b>outcome</b>, 
                    the <b>lenght in time</b> and the <b> settlement</b> for around 300,000 
                    lowsuits produced by several tribunals of the "Giudice di Pace" scattered
                    around Italy. The groups will be provided at the start of the challenge 
                    with a subset of the raw data containing the target variables and, 
                    later on in the challenge, you will be asked to predict those target variables 
                    for a "blind" test set. 
                    Given that the raw data are <i>"probably"</i>
                    not suited to directly be used to make predictions due to all kinds of data problems, 
                    and given that we are simulating a realistic data scientist workflow, the challenge 
                    is splitted into two phases:
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            Data Discovery and Exploration: you should analyze the data
                            in order to search for correlations, missing data, outliers and so on. 
                            At the deadline you will need to provide us a report about your findings
                            and also the code that was used to analyze the data. Each group will be evaluated
                            on the basis of the quality and completeness of their analysis, the clarity with wich 
                            they findings are explaining and the quality of their code. The point is not only making
                            a correct and complete analysis but also convincing us to trust your analysis. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Target Parameter Estimation: each group will be provided with a common 
                            train and validation set and ask to make predictions on the three target
                            variables on a blind test set. You may decide to approach this three problems 
                            but your scores will be based on the following metrics:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>F1-Score</b> for the outcome classification problem;</li>
                                <li>INSERIRE METRICA lenght in time;</li>
                                <li>INSERIRE METRICA settlement;</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>
                            
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
