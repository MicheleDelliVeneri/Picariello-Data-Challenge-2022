						The objective of the challenge is to simulate
						an industrial Data Science project as you would encounter
						working as a data scientist for a company or into an interdisciplinary
						research group. The challenge is about predicting the <b>outcome</b>,
						the <b>duration</b> in number of days and the <b> settlement</b> for
						around 300,000
						lawsuits produced by several tribunals of the "Giudice di Pace" scattered
						around Italy.<br>

					</p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 40px; font-size:20px">
						At the beginning of the challenge, each group will be provided with
						training sets containing all the input data
						fields and the values for the target variables and blind test sets for
						which you will have to make predictions.
						Given that we are simulating an industrial data science project, we are
						not only interested about the performances
						of your algorithms in predicting the target variables,
						but also on the completeness and correctness of your <b class="alert">Exploratory
							Data Analysis</b>
						(EDA) and the <b class="alert">quality</b> of both your <b class="alert">code</b>
						and <b class="alert"> report</b>
						explaining your strategy to solve the problems and the details of the
						algorithms and method used.
